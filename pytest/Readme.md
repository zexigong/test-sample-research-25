## Pytest
### Project URL
[https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest)

### 1. Clone the pytest Repository
First, clone the pytest repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest.git
cd pytest
```

### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment (Windows)
It's recommended to create and activate a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```
### 3. Install Dependencies
Inside the pytest directory, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -U pip wheel setuptools
pip install -e .[testing]
```
This installs pytest in editable mode along with the dependencies needed to run and test pytest itself.

### 4. Run a Test File Inside Pytest
To run a specific test file inside pytest's own test suite, use the following command:
```bash
python -m pytest testing/test_<filename>.py
```
